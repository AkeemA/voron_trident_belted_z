# Voron Trident Belted Z Mod
Belted Z Mod for the Voron Trident 3d printer

Adapted from the Tiny-M Belted Z mod by @quasi (https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M/tree/master/usermods/belted_z_mod)

This was done in Tinkercad - so there is no proper CAD for it. I have below a few 3d views views of the assembly:

a. Full Assembly view

b. Left Z Drive Detail View


The front right will be a mirror of this. The back z drive is setup similarly but has a different mount.
